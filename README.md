# MAS480_MCMC
## What is this repository?
This is my solution for the homework about Markov chain with two different sampling method.  
The homework is provided by Prof. Kang in Mathematics Department, KAIST.  
Two different samplig method are the following.
## Metropolis-Hasting Algorithm
In [Problem_1_MH.py], The Metropolis-Hasting based Markov chain is implemented.
## Gibbs Sampling
In __Problem_2_HS.py__, The Gibbs Sampling based Markov chaing is implemented.
## Other codes
- graph.py  
Introduce a data structure for graph and some functionalities for initializing graph.
 ---
- sampling.py
Introduce some functionalities for sampling from given Markov chain.
